# ABOUT 'SEQWARE.INSTALL' TEMPLATE
# This config template is designed to install SeqWare rather than building it
# from scratch.  It's a lot faster than the standard template which calls
# scripts to build from a source checkout.  But it does a lot less checking
# since it does not run the full unit/integration tests that are part
# of the SeqWare build process
{
  # GENERAL CONFIG
  # will likely make these lower-case in the future
